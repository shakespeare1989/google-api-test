"""Pure-Python application server for testing applications locally.
Given a port and the paths to a valid application directory (with an 'app.yaml'
file), the external library directory, and a relative URL to use for logins,
creates an HTTP server that can be used to test an application locally. Uses
stubs instead of actual APIs when SetupStubs() is called first.
Example:
  root_path = '/path/to/application/directory'
  login_url = '/login'
  port = 8080
  server = dev_appserver.CreateServer(root_path, login_url, port)
  server.serve_forever()
